# Fire Simulation
This is a step-based simulation of a how a fire would progress through a vegetated area. Green squares are trees, brown squares are dirt, red squares are fire, and dark red squares are burnt trees. There are 3 different spread patterns:
- `1` to set spread pattern to 1; only the tree to the right of fire will be set on fire
- `4` to set spread pattern to 4; 4 neighbors of a fire square will be set on fire
- `8` to set spread pattern to 8; 8 neighbors of a fire square will be set on fire
- space to pause/unpause
- `r` to reset

To run the program on windows, download the [windows-amd64 folder](https://github.com/123xxgamer/fireSim/tree/main/fireSim/windows-amd64) and run fireSim.exe
